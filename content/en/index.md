## Structure
An **EAS is the most simple company**.  
The **legal rapresentative must be permanent resident of Paraguay**. We offer two solutions for this: **I can be your appointed legal rapresentative** for an annual fee or you get a second residency in Paraguay. To **become a resident** you need two visits in Paraguay and a fee of about 1000 USD. We have first hand experience with this and you will be 100% approved in a few months.  
You must provide an address in Paraguay for the office (my place is available for this if I will be the legal rapresentative, otherwise there is a shared location).  
**Shareholders can be of any country , individuals or companies**.  

## Taxation
An EAS has 3 taxes:  

- **IVA** (vat) 10% but it's **0%** for us since we invoice out of the country with a semi automated system.  
- **IRE** (income) **3%** on the total income if you don't deduct national expenses (up to 250.000 USD) or **10%** if you deduct expenses.  
- **IDU** (dividend) 8% if the shareholder is a resident, **15%** if not resident, paid only on the **distributed profits** of the company.   

You will be **not perceived as an offshore incorporated business**, with all the annexed consequences to invoice EU/US clients.  

## Compliance
Read the [AML/KYC laws](/en/laws).  
We are consulting with the SEPRELAD to understand the compliance requirements and if these laws also apply to self custodial Bitcoin and crypto self custodial business.  
You can find our [official consultation](/en/consultation) to the SEPRELAD here.  
We expect an official response by Q2/2025.  

## Invoicing
There are few option for invoicing:  
Emit invoices manually from the [Marangatu](https://marangatu.set.gov.py) **online system**. The platform is very simple to use to emit the invoices and fill the monthly and annual returns. Invoices can be emited almost in **any currency**.  
You can emit invoices programmatically with services offering **API** such as [FacturaSend](https://facturasend.com.py/).  
**Our web application** will soon allow to emit invoices in english and get automatically proccessed by our accountant.

## Banking
Paraguay is one of the few countries in the world not exenching information with the **CRS** agreemnt, It technically joined the CRS in 2025 but it is not implemeneted in practice.
Opening a local business bank account for your company is pretty simple.  
Locale corporate bank accounts can be open in **PYG**, **USD**, **EUR**.  
There are **EU and US banks** and Neobanks that operate with Paraguayan company fully remote.
Uruguayan comapny **DLocal** is a good alternative to Stripe that does not only allows process cards, but also **Local bank account** and **Cash remittances** in most of the latam countries.  
**Paysera** can process card specific for European client and it supports Paraguayan companies.   
If you need mainstream providers, the most common alternative is to create a **US/UK/CA** company as a payment processor subsidiary dedicated to processing credit card with **Strip** and banking with **Revolut** or **Wise** company owned by the paraguayan company.
We can also help you to accept **bitcoin** and **USDT** payments with a **self custodial** solution.  

## Funding
One of the way to obtain Paraguayan citizenship after 3 years of permanent residency, is to be a shareholder of a company registered in the country.  
I have some **expats willing to invest in companies to become shareholders not for a profit but for the passport** only.
